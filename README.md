<!-- ABSTRACT -->
## Abstract

Skill score validates a forecast by comparing its accuracy to a reference model. This relative measurement accounts for the variability of the forecast situation and is recommended as a standard metric of accuracy measurement for solar forecasting. We conduct the first meta-analysis of deterministic solar forecasting based on 4,687 skill score observations extracted from literature, using multivariate adaptive regression spline modelling, partial dependence plots, and linear regression. The marginal impacts on skill score of ten factors were quantified, including climate zone, forecast horizon, inputs, forecast models, resolution of forecasts, train and test data length, type of forecasts (i.e., solar resource or PV output forecasting), and publication date. 

The analysis shows the non-linearity and complex interaction between variables in the database. Forecast horizon has a central impact and dominates other factors’ impacts. Skill score increases with horizon for intra-day and intra-hour, but decreases with horizon for day-ahead forecasts. Climate zone variables have statistically significant correlation with skill score. For intra-hour, historical data and spatial temporal information of power system and its neighbours are highly helpful. For intra-day, sky and satellite images show the most important role, which can be combined with any other inputs. For day-ahead, NWP variables and locally measured meteorological data are very efficient. All forecast models were compared. Ensemble–hybrid models achieve the most accurate forecasts for all horizons. Hybrid models show superiority for intra-hour while image-based methods are the most efficient for intra-day forecasts. The choice of reference model matters. Skill score is highest when referenced against persistence model and lowest against the convex combination of smart persistence and climatology models. Resolution of 30 minutes seems the most difficult to forecast. Skill score decreases with the length of test data, especially for intra-hour and intra-day forecasts. More training data can enhance skill score. However, “over-fitting” is observed when there is too much training data (> 2000 days). There has been a substantial improvement in solar forecast accuracy, especially in recent years. More improvement is observed for intra-hour and intra-day than day-ahead forecasts.

<!-- METHODOLOGY -->
## Methodology

An exhaustive search for literature was conducted. Then the literature was screened using well-defined criteria.

 The database was analyzed using statistical methods such as multivariate adaptive regression spline modelling, partial dependence plots, and linear regression.

  <!-- DATABASE -->
## An overview of the database
The database covers 34 countries, over 200 regions, and a variety of climate conditions. More than a half the data are from the USA, followed by France, India, Spain, and Italy (panel b).

<!-- FINDINGS -->
## Key findings
•	The multivariate adaptive regression spline modelling (MARS) and partial dependence plot (PDP) are useful to capture the non-linearity and complex interaction terms in the database.
•	Distinct interactions of variables are observed for each forecast horizon class, i.e., what works for intra-hour does not necessarily work for day-ahead. Therefore, the analysis of the forecast should be done separately for each forecast horizon.
•	There has been a substantial improvement in solar forecast accuracy, especially in recent years. More improvement is observed for intra-hour and intra-day than day-ahead forecasts.
•	Based on the MARS and PDP analysis, a follow-up linear regression is conducted to quantify the marginal impact of important variables on skill score. Findings are:
  
o	Location-related variables such as climate zones show statistically significant correlation with SS. Hence, the relative measurement approach of SS is not sufficient to allow a direct comparison of forecasts. A meta-analysis that can account for different effects is important for knowledge transfer between regions.
o	Skill score shows positive correlation with horizon for intra-hour and intra-day forecasts, which is contradictory with the previous results for other error metrics. This comes from the relative measurement of skill score, which depends on not only the absolute error values of forecasts but also the reference model. 
o	Input usage should consider horizon class. For intra-hour, historical data and spatial temporal information of power system and its neighbours are highly helpful. For intra-day, sky and satellite images show the most important role, which can be combined with any other inputs. For day-ahead, NWP variables and locally measured meteorological data are very efficient.
o	Regarding the inter-model comparison, ensemble–hybrid models achieve the most accurate forecasts. Many methods do not show a robust superiority to time series methods. Therefore, it is recommended to consider improving the performance of simple models through using different techniques and processing input data before moving on to complex models.
